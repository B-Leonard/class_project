What happened was I was walking in my neighborhood when I noticed a large dog running towards me.
And then I noticed an FBI Spy Van repeatedly saying "Hello World!" on a load speaker.
The dog proceeded to stand on its hind legs, say my full name, address, social security number and my place of employment,
