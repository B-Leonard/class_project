What happened was I was walking in my neighborhood when I noticed a large dog running towards me.
And then I noticed an FBI Spy Van repeatedly saying "Hello World!" on a load speaker. The dog proceeded to stand on its hind legs, say my full name, address, social security number and my place of employment,
which by this point I was already expecting. I touched my earpiece and called out "the missions a go", signaling to the agents
that it was time. 
A flock of pigeons in tactical vests dive-bombed the cul-de-sac while Alexa narrated the whole thing in Morgan Freeman's voice. 
As the pigeons were flying in, the agents disguised as cats flooded the streets.
The cats surrounded the dog while he tied a headband on, taking a stance.
One of the agents, dressed as a particularly fluffy Marine Coon, whispered into my earpiece: "The headband was a decoy--we need backup from the raccoons."
The agent fled the battlefield to find the leader of the racoons.
